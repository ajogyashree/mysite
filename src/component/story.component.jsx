            <h3>Why this Domain?</h3>
            <p>I get a lot of questions about the domain I use i.e "ajogyashree". The domain name is a mix of two words: "ajogya" and "shree". "Ajogya" is odia word for the hindi word "Ayogya" which is the english word for "Worthless". "Shree" is another name for the hindu goddess of wealth. </p>
            <p>When I thought of getting a domain of my own, I came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushpa_Kamal_Dahal">Mr Pushpa Kamal Dahal</a>, who took on the name "Prachanda" so that people cannot know about his caste from his name only.</p>
            <p>His ideology on this inspired me to find out an alternate name for myself and after thinking "Ajogya" is what I could think of.</p>
