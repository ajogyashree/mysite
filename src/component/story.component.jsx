                    <h3>Why this Domain?</h3>
                    <p>I get a lot of questions about the domain i use i.e ajogyashree . There is kind of astory behind this. The domain name is a mix of two words: 'ajogya' and 'shree'. 'Ajogya' is odia word for the hindi word 'Ayogya' which is the english word for 'Worthless'. Wordception anyone. 'Shree' obviously comes from my name 'Sreepati' which is another name for the hindu goddess of wealth. </p>
                    <p>Now why did I think of this instead of using my name. When I thought of getting a domain of my own, I was living alone and was dependent on Birendra who used to cook for me. He was a Nepalese and used to cook tasty stuff.</p>
